**Beginner's Guide**

This branch is being updated at [AStupidRat's Github Repository](https://github.com/AStupidRat/RatPoison)
The official branch is located at [Jire's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Jire/Charlatano)

Before doing anything, make sure you have
[Java Development Kit (JDK) 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
installed. This is NOT the same thing as the regular Java Runtime (JRE), and you MUST install the JDK
in order to build Charlatano, as well as any other Java software, and you MUST install JDK 8 (as far as I know)

The first step is to compile the source code into a usable cheat program.

* Visit this branches [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AStupidRat/Charlatano)
* Click on the [**Releases**](https://github.com/Rat/Charlatano/releases) tab and download the latest release ZIP archive
* OR
* Download the latest updates (which includes the newest features) by downloading directly as a ZIP
* Extract the contents from the archive to any folder (to your desktop, for example)
* Make sure you have Java Development Kit 8 or later installed
* Double click on the "_build_" (_build.bat_) script and wait for it to complete

Once those steps are complete, the usable cheat program can be found within the _build_
directory, and will in a directory called **RatPoison 1.1**.

From within the **RatPoison 1.1** directory, you can start the cheat by running
the _"Start RatPoison 1.1"_ script.

Before starting the cheat, you should already be spawned in a game with a weapon in hand!
