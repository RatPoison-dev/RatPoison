## Beginner's guide video <a name = "video"></a>

[![video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/LXBTAnnwahU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXBTAnnwahU)

Recommended to watch before continuing.

## Compilation <a name = "compilation"></a>
The first step is to compile the source code into a usable cheat program.

* Download the latest updates (which includes the newest features) by downloading directly as a ZIP.
* Extract the contents from the archive to any folder (to your desktop, for example).
* Double click on the "_installer_" (_installer.exe_) script and wait for it to complete.

Once those steps are complete, the usable cheat program can be found within the _build_
directory, and will be in a directory called **RatPoison 1.7**.

From within the **RatPoison 1.7** directory, you can start the cheat by running
the _"Start RatPoison 1.7"_ script.
If you have chosen to randomize the cheat name, you should open the file ending in .bat which should show ![BatFile](https://i.imgur.com/JZAhmtr.png) as an icon.

You can launch the cheat at any time after launching CSGO.

## Common issues <a name = "issues"></a>
* Overlay is black/doesn't go transparent/isn't showing up
    * The overlay only works on Windows 10, it doesn't turn transparent on W7
    * CSGO needs to be borderless/windowed for the overlay to show up on top of CS, otherwise it's just an app in your taskbar
    * JDK 1.8 is also known to cause this problem, make sure you have JDK 12 or later installed

* Console is being spammed with GLFW errors
    * Usually a result of unsupported or misconfigured hardware
    * In some cases <code>GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR</code> can be fixed by [forcing dedicated GPU on java.exe process](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6048#issuecomment-660468942).
    * If RatPoison 1.6 worked fine for you but 1.7 spams OpenGL errors, try editing [this](https://github.com/TheRatCode/RatPoison/blob/82f7a76e6115c8840e4188cffdb8f10b831ae385/src/main/kotlin/rat/poison/RatPoison.kt#L183) line to <code>useOpenGL3(true, 3, 2)</code> and rebuild the cheat.

* Game looks framey despite having normal FPS (example 144hz/144fps, but looks like 60)
    * Lowering opengl fps to 30 helps
    * Enabling gsync & disabling vsync if supported
   
* Cheat is stuck at launching? Make sure you have checked all of those steps:
    * CS:GO is running
    * you are running currently most up-to-date version of RatPoison
    * you disabled all anti-cheat clients working on your computer
    * your RatPoison folder is placed somewhere with all running permissions
    * you don't use RatPoison with some other cheats running
    * you aren't currently running VAC bypass (running the bat file with administrator privileges should work)
    * you restarted your computer
    
 		**If nothing else works then you can try running the bat file as admin.**
	
* Map is unusually bright after joining the server/Nightmode does not work
	* Untick Disable Post Processing option in Misc tab
	
* Backtrack does not seem to work, hit rate is awfully low
	* Unbind mouse1 in console, disable spotted only in backtrack settings or use triggerbot with shoot backtrack enabled.
	
* Installer is detected by antivirus as a malicious program
	* False-positive, add the executable to exclusions or exclude the whole folder in your antivirus.
